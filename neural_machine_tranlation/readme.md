## **Neural Machine Translation**
###### **Neural Machine Translation is a special area of NLP, defined as the act of translation with the help of an artificial neural network. Here, we will learn about:**
* How Neural Machine Translation works
* NMT by jointly learning to align and tranlate
* Attention based NMT
* The dataset we will use

## **Neural Machine Translation**
###### **Neural Machine Translation is a special area of NLP, defined as the act of translation with the help of an artificial neural network. Here, we will learn about:**
* How Neural Machine Translation works
* NMT by jointly learning to align and tranlate
* Attention based NMT
* The dataset we will use

#### **Configuring the Environment**
###### **We need to have the Tensorflow and Tensorflow Text library installed in our system. Both are pip-installable:**
* `pip install tensorflow`
* `pip install tensorflow-text`
